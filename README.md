### How did you come up with your name?
My name is Daniel Simonsen, and my iconic number is 90 so put those together and there we go.

### What caught your interest into coding?
Ever since I was introduced to Minecraft's redstone mechanics, I loved to make my own contraptions, and as time passed by, moved on to simple Excel calculations and little RPG game designing using [RPG Maker XP](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-xp). <br />
Finally, I got the opportunity to be taught very basic HTML and your classic traffic light assignment using C - this is where I knew I wanted to keep programming and therefore started my "Datatechnician with Speciality in Programming" education.

### What is your favorite project?
My favorite project is my Discord Bot, Pingu. <br />
Pingu is my first JavaScript project, which I incoporated a little TypeScript with. <br />
My plan for Pingu, is for him to become the best Discord bot with famous features from other bots like:
* [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz/dashboard) & [Dyno](https://dyno.gg/account)'s moderation system
* [Rythm](https://rythm.fm/) & [Groovy](https://groovy.bot/)'s music commands and ability to play sounds from other providers than YouTube; i.e. Spotify & SoundCloud
* [ReactionRoles](https://top.gg/bot/550613223733329920)'s reaction roles
* [Poll Bot](https://top.gg/bot/pollbot)'s polls
* [GiveawayBot](https://giveawaybot.party/)'s giveaways
* [Miki](https://top.gg/bot/miki)'s daily streaks, chat achievements & ability to marry a member

### Favorite language?
JavaScript. <br />
Even though I'm taught in C# in school, ever since I got into JavaScript and TypeScript, I felt like there was finally a language that did what I wanted in an easy way.  <br />
I also really enjoy coding in C#, but in terms of async code, handling events, being able to only give the programmer very specific parameter options using TypeScript's "type" keyword, the simplicity of making an array/object and let alone the spread syntax (...), are all situations I much rather would use JavaScript than C#.  <br />
Besides, most people dislike JavaScript for the fact it isn't 100% type dependent, which I can understand, but it doesn't bother me personally, as all I want is being able to see what type of object I'm dealing with - and I can still do that either by using TypeScript or by defining a summary for the function I'm in.
